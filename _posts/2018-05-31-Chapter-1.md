In today's episode, the gals discuss Bridget Jones' Diary, written by Helen Fielding.

## Notes from the show

Holly mentioned the belief that Helen Fielding based the characters of Daniel Cleever and Mark Darcy off of Hugh Grant and Colin Firth. Wouldn't you know it, her memory was right! Per the [LA Times' interview](http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-ca-mn-bridget-jones-diary-oral-history-20160410-story.html) with Sharon Maguire who directed the film _Bridet Jones' Diary_:

>_It was going to be an indie movie, really, but when Hugh Grant agreed to play Daniel Cleaver and Colin Firth agreed to play Mr. Darcy, it became a much more commercial prospect. **Helen had based the characters in the book on both of them.** Colin was on BBC's "Pride and Prejudice," and she was obsessed with him, as were most of the females in the nation._

Holly also suggested a YouTube video for the show 24, but set in 1995. Well... She almost got it right. The video's actually called "24: The Unaired 1994 Pilot".

Stasia mentioned there being multiple narrators from the audio books that she heard.
