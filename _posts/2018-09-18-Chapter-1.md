In today's episode, the gals discuss Bridget Jones' Diary, written by Helen Fielding.

## Notes from the show

[Helen Fielding based the characters of Daniel Cleever and Mark Darcy off of Hugh Grant and Colin Firth](http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-ca-mn-bridget-jones-diary-oral-history-20160410-story.html):

_It was going to be an indie movie, really, but when Hugh Grant agreed to play Daniel Cleaver and Colin Firth agreed to play Mr. Darcy, it became a much more commercial prospect. **Helen had based the characters in the book on both of them.** Colin was on BBC's "Pride and Prejudice," and she was obsessed with him, as were most of the females in the nation._
